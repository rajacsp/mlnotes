      "142 I want Maple Loops.\n",
      "143 You know who wrote that song? - Your uncle Charlie wrote that.\n",
      "144 - No lie? If I was to lie, I'd say I wrote Stairway to Heaven, not the Maple Loops song.\n",
      "145 - You two are really good together.\n",
      "146 - Thank you.\n",
      "147 So, does your wife sing, too? - No, I'm not married.\n",
      "148 - What a shame.\n",
      "149 Wow.\n",
      "150 You're even better than a dog.\n",
      "151 Dr.\n",
      "152 Bloom? Yes, this is Alan Harper.\n",
      "153 My wife and I need to cancel our marriage counseling appointment for this afternoon.\n",
      "154 Yes, well, something came up.\n",
      "155 Well, it's kind of personal.\n",
      "156 I mean Well, yeah, I know the point of these things is I've got to go.\n",
      "157 - Hello? - Is Charlie home? No.\n",
      "158 I'm Charlie's brother.\n",
      "159 Can I help you? Hi, Charlie's brother.\n",
      "160 I'm Rose.\n",
      "161 I'm Charlie's housekeeper.\n",
      "162 So, you're a housekeeper? Housekeeper /actress/hand model.\n",
      "163 I just do this to keep the wolf from the door.\n",
      "164 You know what I mean? Sure.\n",
      "165 Come on in.\n",
      "166 Yeah, I can smell him.\n",
      "167 Smell who? Your brother.\n",
      "168 He has a very musky scent.\n",
      "169 Well, I'll just let you get to work.\n",
      "170 Wait.\n",
      "171 No.\n",
      "172 It's okay.\n",
      "173 Jake, buddy.\n",
      "174 Take a break.\n",
      "175 What took you so long? We stopped for ice cream because I'm a babe magnet.\n",
      "176 I got to take a squirt.\n",
      "177 Why do you assume he learned that from me? Because I learned it from you.\n",
      "178 - Hey, thanks for cleaning up.\n",
      "179 - No, it wasn't me.\n",
      "180 Rose was here.\n",
      "181 Rose? You let Rose into my house? She said she was your maid.\n",
      "182 Hell, she glued the damn cabinets shut again.\n",
      "183 Again? You've got somebody who comes in regularly to glue your cabinets? You've met some of the whack jobs I've gone out with.\n",
      "184 - It's not that big a stretch.\n",
      "185 - So, this is my fault? Who let her in? You're a deeply disturbed man, you know? Move it.\n",
      "186 Come on.\n",
      "187 I'm deeply disturbed? Who came here in the middle of the night with his own sheets? At least, I care what I sleep on.\n",
      "188 Or should I say, who I sleep on.\n",
      "189 Hey, pal, of the two of us, I'll bet I'm the only one who's slept with a married woman recently.\n",
      "190 And isn't that something to brag about? Hi, Mom.\n",
      "191 Do you have any idea how hurtful it is to hear about your own son's divorce on the street? What divorce? What street? How did you get in my house? You stay out of this.\n",
      "192 I'm here to help your brother through a very difficult time.\n",
      "193 How could you do this to me? Do what? Now when I want to see my grandson I am going to have to make an appointment with Judith, who, let's face it, was never very warm to me.\n",
      "194 And what if there's another man there? Shacking up with her? Have we even stopped to consider that? I think he's considering it now, Mom.\n",
      "195 - Here's your iced tea, Grandma.\n",
      "196 - Thank you, my little angel.\n",
      "197 Darling, I asked for a lemon wedge.\n",
      "198 All right.\n",
      "199 Here's what you're going to do.\n",
      "200 You and Jake will come live with me.\n",
      "201 After all, I'm just rattling around in that big house all by myself.\n",
      "202 That's very considerate, but as soon as Judith and I work things out, I'm going to be back at my own house.\n",
      "203 Sweetheart, grow up.\n",
      "204 Think about what I said.\n",
      "205 You're my son, and I'll always have room for you in my house and in my heart.\n",
      "206 I love you, too, Mom.\n",
      "207 - I love you, too, Mom.\n",
      "208 - Too little.\n",
      "209 Too late.\n",
      "210 - So, Vegas was good? - It was fine.\n",
      "211 Alan, I really want to apologize for putting you through this.\n",
      "212 I was wrong to blame you for my unhappiness.\n",
      "213 No, no need to apologize.\n",
      "214 What's important is that we're here and we're working on our marriage.\n",
      "215 You look great, by the way.\n",
      "216 Must be all the extra oxygen they pump into the casinos.\n",
      "217 - Alan - And you were right.\n",
      "218 I see now that the time apart did us both a lot of good.\n",
      "219 I know I've grown.\n",
      "220 I'm not that suffocating guy you threw out of the house four and a half days ago, let me tell you that.\n",
      "221 Jake's doing fine.\n",
      "222 You were concerned about him being around my brother, but Charlie's great with kids.\n",
      "223 All right, last card, down and dirty.\n",
      "224 King's bet.\n",
      "225 - $1.\n",
      "226 - I'm in.\n",
      "227 In.\n",
      "228 I'll see $1 and raise it $5.\n",
      "229 You raised $5 on that? - I call.\n",
      "230 - I call.\n",
      "231 Queens full of nines.\n",
      "232 Kid, don't you know what a full house is? Yeah.\n",
      "233 And I also know what a psych-out is.\n",
      "234 I love this boy.\n",
      "235 And I think we're gonna look back on this as a new beginning for our marriage.\n",
      "236 A rebirth.\n",
      "237 A renaissance, if you will.\n",
      "238 Alan, I think I'm gay.\n",
      "239 All right.\n",
      "240 We'll make a list.\n",
      "241 On one side, we'll put gay stuff I'll see you and raise you $20.\n",
      "242 - I think he's got you, pal.\n",
      "243 - He's bluffing.\n",
      "244 He always pulls his ear when he bluffs.\n",
      "245 How about it, Mighty Mouse? You in? Take him down.\n",
      "246 Call you.\n",
      "247 I hate this kid.\n",
      "248 What the hell is going on here? You said \"hell.\n",
      "249 \" - Throw $1 in the pot.\n",
      "250 - What? Hey, we all had to.\n",
      "251 Charlie, may I speak with you privately, please? - Whose deal is it? - Jake, go to bed! I'm out.\n",
      "252 What is wrong with you? Are you insane? Do you have any sense of right and wrong? Probably not.\n",
      "253 How was dinner? How could you put Jake in a poker game with grown men? I obviously can't be trusted.\n",
      "254 So, how was dinner? I leave you alone with him for a couple of hours I'm just gonna keep asking, Alan.\n",
      "255 Dinner was swell.\n",
      "256 We both had the veal piccata and she's gay! Wow.\n",
      "257 Most chicks won't eat veal.\n",
      "258 Why do I even try talking to you? Come on, I'm just trying to get you to lighten up a little.\n",
      "259 I don't need to lighten up.\n",
      "260 The world I live in is dark.\n",
      "261 Dark and rainy.\n",
      "262 And you're useless in it! Really? I wasn't useless when you needed a place to stay.\n",
      "263 Obviously that was a mistake.\n",
      "264 Are you sure? Maybe we should make a list.\n",
      "265 Uncle Charlie? What's going on? Can't sleep? No.\n",
      "266 My dad says we're moving to Grandma's tomorrow.\n",
      "267 Yeah, that'd keep me up.\n",
      "268 If it makes you feel any better, you won $80 on that last hand.\n",
      "269 $85.\n",
      "270 $80.\n",
      "271 The house gets a cut.\n",
      "272 I wish my dad was as cool as you.\n",
      "273 Don't sell your dad short.\n",
      "274 He loves you more than anything in the world.\n",
      "275 You know that, don't you? I guess.\n",
      "276 How come you don't have any kids? I don't know.\n",
      "277 Maybe because I love me more than anything in the world.\n",
      "278 - Uncle Charlie? - Yeah? I don't want to go to Grandma's.\n",
      "279 I'd rather stay here.\n",
      "280 Yeah, well, your dad knows what's best for you.\n",
      "281 Okay.\n",
      "282 Good night, Uncle Charlie.\n",
      "283 I love you.\n",
      "284 Yeah.\n",
      "285 Okay.\n",
      "286 You got to love a kid like that.\n",
      "287 I even played him Stairway to Heaven and he still liked the Maple Loops song better.\n",
      "288 Charlie, I haven't seen you in two weeks.\n",
      "289 You finally got the house back to yourself.\n",
      "290 Now, do you want to talk about your nephew, or do you want to have sex? Sex.\n",
      "291 Definitely sex.\n",
      "292 - Let me ask you something.\n",
      "293 - Yeah? Do you ever think about having kids? Whoa, we've got a good thing going.\n",
      "294 Can't we just leave it at that? What are you doing? I thought we were gonna have sex.\n",
      "295 How am I supposed to have sex while your biological clock is going off? Hey, it's Charlie.\n",
      "296 Do your thing when you hear the beep.\n",
      "297 Hi, Monkey Man.\n",
      "298 I was just thinking about you and wondering why we hurt each other so much.\n",
