```python
!python --version
```

    Python 3.12.4



```python
from constants import OPENAI_API_KEY
```


```python
!pip show langchain-openai | grep "Version:"
```

    Version: 0.2.9



```python
import os
```


```python
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = OPENAI_API_KEY
```


```python
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
```


```python
# https://python.langchain.com/docs/how_to/binding/
```


```python
from langchain_core.output_parsers import StrOutputParser
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate
from langchain_core.runnables import RunnablePassthrough
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(
    [
        (
            "system",
            "Write out the following equation using algebraic symbols then solve it. Use the format\n\nEQUATION:...\nSOLUTION:...\n\n",
        ),
        ("human", "{equation_statement}"),
    ]
)

model = ChatOpenAI(temperature=0)

runnable = (
    {"equation_statement": RunnablePassthrough()} | prompt | model | StrOutputParser()
)
```


```python
print(runnable.invoke("x raised to the third plus seven equals 12"))
```

    EQUATION: x^3 + 7 = 12
    
    SOLUTION: 
    Subtract 7 from both sides:
    x^3 = 5
    
    Take the cube root of both sides:
    x = âˆ›5



```python

```


```python
runnable = (
    {"equation_statement": RunnablePassthrough()}
    | prompt
    | model.bind(stop="SOLUTION")
    | StrOutputParser()
)

print(runnable.invoke("x raised to the third plus seven equals 12"))
```

    EQUATION: x^3 + 7 = 12
    
    



```python

```
